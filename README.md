Coding Assessment

## Description
 The Coding Assessment is a 75 second, timed quiz with six multiple choice questions. If a user gets a question incorrect, they lose 10 seconds off the clock. The time left on the timer, becomes the user's high score. At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials to add their score to the high scores list saved to local storage. At the end of the quiz, the user can view the high scores, clear the high scores from local storage, or go back and redo the quiz.
